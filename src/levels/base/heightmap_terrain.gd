class_name HeightmapTerrain
extends StaticBody3D
## Terrain from a heightmap image: a greyscale texture becomes both a
## welded ground mesh and a matching HeightMapShape3D. This is the §2-rule-2 ground
## path — a dedicated collision surface, never a trimesh scatter. One grid cell = one
## world unit, so the mesh and collision vertices coincide exactly (no shape scaling).
##
## @tool so authors see the terrain in the editor; call rebuild() after changing the
## image or size. Cells sample the red channel as normalized height [0,1] * height.
##
## Generation/chunking:
##  - The render mesh is CHUNKED (one MeshInstance3D per chunk_cells tile) so island-
##    scale maps frustum-cull instead of drawing one giant always-on mesh. Culling
##    granularity only, not LOD. Collision stays ONE HeightMapShape3D (§2-2 untouched).
##  - A FastNoiseLite GENERATOR (preset/seed/feature scale/octaves + island falloff +
##    terrace plateaus) behind Generate / Generate-random tool buttons ("random" just
##    rolls a fresh seed into gen_seed): destructive-by-button, deterministic from the seed,
##    one undoable action, writes the level's heightmap PNG (pipeline unchanged). The
##    world amplitude is the existing `height` export — generated pixels stay [0,1].
##  - An AUTO-SPLAT button seeding the RGBA splatmap (kit/terrain/terrain_splat.gdshader
##    colors: R=grass G=dirt B=sand A=rock) from slope + height, same undo discipline.
##    Pure math lives in TerrainGen (kit/terrain/terrain_gen.gd), unit-tested.
##
## Ground painting has EIGHT channels: 0..3 are splatmap.RGBA, 4..7 the optional
## splatmap2.RGBA (absent = the plain 4-channel terrain, unchanged). Both the colors and the
## names are per-level data — the colors ARE the material's shader params (edit them on the
## material to repaint a level's palette), the names are `channel_names` below. Auto-splat
## still only classifies the base four.

## This is the seam the kit brush needs: it keeps a decoded working copy of each image in
